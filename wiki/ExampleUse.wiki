= Introduction =

This is a brief example of using this program, along with mjpegtools, imagemagick, flac, cdrkit, and dvdauthor to genereate a DVD image, with each song track being a chapter.

THIS GUIDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT YET FINISHED


= Details =

For this example, I'm going to be using the 24-bit, 96kHz FLAC version of Nine Inch Nails' [http://theslip.nin.com/ The Slip].  It's available for free, so it makes for a great example.

I'm assuming that, at this point, you've already obtained the material, and have all needed programs installed, including wav2dvdlpcm-24bit.

==Step 1==
Navigate to your project directory, we should have all the FLAC files in here.  We'll setup an empty audio.lpcm file, as well as an empty start-points file, and an end-point file:

{{{
touch audio.lpcm
touch start-points.txt
touch end-point.txt
}}}

The start-points value will contain our track starting points, as raw audio bytes.  We'll use these to figure out our chapters.

==Step 2 - Generate Audio Stream==
Next, we'll decode the audio, and keep track of where each track starts, as well as the final byte count:
{{{
for file in *.flac; do stat -c "%s" audio.lpcm >> start-points.txt; flac -d -c --force-raw-format --sign=signed --endian=little "$file" | wav2dvdlpcm-24bit -r >> audio.lpcm; done; stat -c "%s" audio.lpcm >> end-point.txt
}}}

So now, assuming you're using the Nine Inch Nails "The Slip," your start-points file should contain:
{{{
0
49282704
185338860
317531808
466821636
631124508
801110796
922043748
1183340856
1343253876
}}}
and the end-point should be:
{{{
1514958180
}}}
